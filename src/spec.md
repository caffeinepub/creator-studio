# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a TikTok-style video sharing platform where a single creator can upload videos for fans to watch, with owner-only upload restrictions via Internet Identity.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement Internet Identity authentication to restrict uploads to the owner
- Create video upload functionality with metadata (title, description, timestamp) stored in stable memory
- Build a TikTok-style profile page with profile picture, username, bio, and video count
- Create a scrollable video feed where fans can browse and watch videos
- Design vibrant, modern UI with bold colors (avoiding blue/purple), smooth animations, and social media aesthetic

**User-visible outcome:** The owner can authenticate and upload videos with titles and descriptions. All visitors can view the creator's profile and watch videos in a feed without authentication. The app has an engaging, modern social media appearance.
