  "summary": "The implementation comprehensively covers all specified requirements. Owner-only video uploads are enforced via Internet Identity authentication and admin role checks. The video feed is publicly accessible without authentication. A TikTok-style profile page, video feed with grid layout, and video player are implemented. The visual theme uses warm orange/red tones (avoiding blue/purple) with modern typography and smooth animations throughout. All acceptance criteria appear satisfied.",

      "description": "Profile setup modal and user profile management system",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not mention user profiles, profile creation modals, or username/bio functionality. REQ-3 only requests displaying 'creator's profile information' but the diff implements a full profile system where authenticated users can create/edit profiles with names stored in backend state.",
