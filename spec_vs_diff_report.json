  "summary": "All four requirements are substantially implemented. The backend adds an optional thumbnail field and uploadThumbnail endpoint (REQ-1), the upload page adds an optional thumbnail picker with preview (REQ-2), VideoCard displays thumbnails with a placeholder fallback (REQ-3), and VideoPlayerPage sets the poster attribute from the thumbnail (REQ-4). One acceptance criterion has a gap: the backend's uploadThumbnail does not verify that the caller is the video owner before updating, only that they have the #user role.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Non-owners cannot update another user's thumbnail.",
      "reason": "The uploadThumbnail function in backend/main.mo only checks that the caller has the #user permission, but does not verify that the caller is the owner (uploader) of the video. Any authenticated user can overwrite another user's thumbnail.",
