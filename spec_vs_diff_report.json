  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements for enabling video thumbnail uploads. Backend adds optional thumbnail field to Video records and accepts it in uploadVideo; frontend adds thumbnail file input with preview on UploadVideoPage, displays thumbnails in VideoCard with fallback, and sets poster attribute in VideoPlayerPage. All major acceptance criteria appear to be met.",

      "description": "A separate uploadThumbnail endpoint was added to the backend, allowing post-upload thumbnail association by video ID.",
      "reason": "The build request only requires persisting thumbnail alongside the video upload (extend existing endpoint). A separate dedicated endpoint for uploading thumbnails after-the-fact was not explicitly requested, though it is used sequentially in the frontend flow.",
