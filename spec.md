# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Move the About section to the top of the VideoFeedPage, above the video grid.

**Planned changes:**
- Reorder the VideoFeedPage so the AboutSection component renders above the video grid
- Ensure WaveDivider components still appropriately separate the About section from adjacent content

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors to the page will see Florida Dave's about info at the top before scrolling down to the video grid.
