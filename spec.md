# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add an "About Florida Dave" section with a wave SVG divider to the existing app.

**Planned changes:**
- Add an "About Florida Dave" section to the home/feed page with a short bio paragraph describing Florida Dave as a 40-year-old entrepreneur building ideas publicly — spanning content creation and domain investing — and documenting the journey toward location freedom and beach living
- Add a subtle full-width wave-shaped SVG divider adjacent to the About section to visually separate it from surrounding content, styled to harmonize with the existing color palette

**User-visible outcome:** Users can see an "About Florida Dave" bio section on the page, separated from adjacent content by a subtle wave divider.
